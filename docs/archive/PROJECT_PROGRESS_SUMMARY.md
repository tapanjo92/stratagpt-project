# Australian Strata GPT - Project Progress Summary

## Overview
This document captures all work completed on the Australian Strata GPT project through Phase 2.1, including critical fixes and enhancements implemented during the current session.

## Project Status Summary

### Completed Phases
- ✅ **Phase 1.1-1.4**: Infrastructure, ingestion pipeline, vector storage, monitoring
- ✅ **Phase 2.1**: RAG implementation with Kendra and Bedrock (with fixes)

### Major Achievements

#### 1. Tenant Isolation Fixed
- **Problem**: Kendra was returning documents from all tenants regardless of tenant_id
- **Root Cause**: S3 data source metadata sync wasn't working properly
- **Solution**: Implemented custom ingestion using Kendra's batch_put_document API
- **Result**: Tenant isolation now working correctly - queries only return tenant-specific documents

#### 2. Fully Automated Document Ingestion
- **Initial Approach**: Manual script (ingest-to-kendra.py)
- **Final Solution**: Fully automated via CDK with EventBridge rules
- **Benefits**: 
  - Zero manual intervention required
  - Documents automatically indexed on S3 upload
  - ~15 second end-to-end processing time
  - Proper tenant metadata association

#### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
- Created new Integration Stack for event-driven architecture
- Added DynamoDB document tracking table
- Implemented proper IAM permissions including PassRole for Kendra
- Fixed circular dependency issues in CDK

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Custom Kendra Ingestion Lambda
Location: `/root/strata-project/backend/lambdas/kendra-custom-ingest/handler.py`

Key features:
- Extracts tenant_id from S3 path (e.g., tenant-a/documents/file.pdf)
- Uses batch_put_document API for direct document indexing
- Adds proper metadata attributes for tenant isolation
- Tracks all documents in DynamoDB for audit trail
- Handles both document creation and deletion events

#### RAG Query Handler Updates
Location: `/root/strata-project/backend/lambdas/rag-query/handler.py`

Key changes:
- Added AttributeFilter to Kendra queries
- Filters results by tenant_id for proper isolation
- Only returns documents belonging to the requesting tenant

#### CDK Infrastructure Changes

1. **RAG Stack** (`/root/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk/stacks/rag-stack.ts`):
   - Added custom ingestion Lambda function
   - Created DynamoDB document tracking table
   - Configured proper IAM permissions

2. **Integration Stack** (`/root/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk/stacks/integration-stack.ts`):
   - New stack for event-driven architecture
   - EventBridge rules for S3 events
   - Automatic document ingestion triggers
   - Supports multiple file types (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .html)

## Current Architecture

### Document Flow
```
1. Document Upload → S3 (tenant-{id}/documents/filename.ext)
2. S3 Event → EventBridge 
3. EventBridge Rule → Kendra Ingestion Lambda
4. Lambda → Extract tenant_id → batch_put_document → Kendra Index
5. Document tracked in DynamoDB
6. Document available for tenant-specific queries
```

### Query Flow
```
1. User Query (with tenant_id context)
2. RAG Query Lambda → Kendra search with AttributeFilter
3. Kendra → Returns only tenant-specific documents
4. Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) → Generate answer with citations
5. Response returned to user
```

## Testing Results

### Tenant Isolation Testing
- ✅ Tenant A can only see Tenant A documents
- ✅ Tenant B can only see Tenant B documents
- ✅ Tenant C documents automatically ingested and isolated
- ✅ Cross-tenant queries return no results (as expected)

### Automatic Ingestion Testing
- ✅ Document uploaded to S3 automatically indexed in ~15 seconds
- ✅ Metadata properly associated
- ✅ Queries immediately return newly indexed documents
- ✅ Document deletion events properly handled

## Key Files Modified

### Lambda Functions
- `/root/strata-project/backend/lambdas/rag-query/handler.py` - Added tenant filtering
- `/root/strata-project/backend/lambdas/kendra-custom-ingest/handler.py` - New custom ingestion

### CDK Stacks
- `/root/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk/stacks/rag-stack.ts` - Added ingestion Lambda and DynamoDB
- `/root/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk/stacks/integration-stack.ts` - New event-driven integration
- `/root/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk/bin/strata-cdk.ts` - Added Integration Stack to app

### Documentation
- `/root/strata-project/KENDRA_METADATA_ISSUE.md` - Analysis of S3 sync problem
- `/root/strata-project/CUSTOM_INGESTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details
- `/root/strata-project/FULLY_AUTOMATED_INGESTION.md` - Final architecture documentation
- `/root/strata-project/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with current status

## Known Issues Resolved

1. **Kendra S3 Data Source Metadata Sync**: 
   - Issue: Metadata files not being associated with documents
   - Resolution: Replaced with custom ingestion using batch_put_document

2. **CDK Circular Dependency**:
   - Issue: Could not add S3 notifications from RAG stack to Storage stack
   - Resolution: Created separate Integration Stack with EventBridge rules

3. **IAM PassRole Permission**:
   - Issue: Lambda couldn't pass Kendra role when calling batch_put_document
   - Resolution: Added explicit PassRole permission in CDK

## Next Steps (Phase 2.2 and Beyond)

1. **Phase 2.2**: Implement Chat API with conversation history
2. **Phase 2.3**: Add admin portal for document management
3. **Phase 2.4**: Implement feedback and improvement system
4. **Phase 3**: Scale to production with multi-region support

## Cost Considerations
- Kendra Developer Edition: $810/month
- OpenSearch: Using t3.small for cost optimization
- Bedrock: Pay-per-token usage
- Consider production optimization strategies

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Deploy all stacks
cd ~/strata-project/infrastructure/cdk
npm run build
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1 cdk deploy --all

# Test RAG query
cd ~/strata-project/scripts
python3 strata-utils.py query "What is the quorum for an AGM?"

# Run evaluation
python3 run-evaluation.py

# Check Kendra status
python3 strata-utils.py status
```

## Summary
The Australian Strata GPT project has successfully completed Phase 2.1 with a fully functional RAG system. The critical tenant isolation issue has been resolved through custom Kendra ingestion, and the entire document processing pipeline is now fully automated via CDK infrastructure. The system is ready for the next phases of development.
