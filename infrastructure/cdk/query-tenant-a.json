This means that owners representing at least 50% of the total unit entitlements in the strata scheme must be present (either in person or by proxy) for the AGM to proceed.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the quorum requirements may vary depending on the state or territory legislation that applies to your strata scheme. For example, in New South Wales, the quorum for an AGM is generally 25% of the total unit entitlements, as per Section 16 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW). In Queensland, the quorum is 25% of the total number of lots, as per Section 82 of the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 (QLD).\\n\\nIf the required quorum is not met at the scheduled AGM, the meeting may need to be adjourned and reconvened at a later date. It's crucial to check the specific quorum requirements in your state or territory's strata legislation and ensure that the quorum is met for your strata scheme's AGM to be valid and able to make binding decisions.\", \"citations\": [{\"document_id\": \"s3://strata-documents-809555764832-ap-south-1/tenant-a/documents/test-doc.txt\", \"title\": \"Test Doc.Txt\", \"excerpt\": \"...Test document for tenant-a.
